The health of tens of thousands of responders, survivors, and their families continues to be affected by the 9/11 attacks. This repository serves as a vital safeguard to ensure the ongoing availability of crucial data related to their health, particularly [in light of recent staff reductions](https://www.renew911health.org/attempted-cuts-to-the-staff-of-the-world-trade-center-health-program-and-cuts-to-9-11-cancer-research/) at the World Trade Center Health Program and across federal health agencies.
